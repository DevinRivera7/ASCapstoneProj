# ASCapstoneProj
Here are the files used within my Cybersecurity and Network Engineering Capstone Project for my Associate's Degree at NEIT

During these tasks, we were asked to do 11 tasks. These tasks consisted of building a simulation in Packet Tracer of a fully functioning network that includes IP static routes, Inter-VLAN Routing, DNS configuration, DHCP configuration within multiple VLANs, Active Directory and more!

I provided documentation of the process of building this project as well as the configuration scripts we made for each switch and router within this network.
